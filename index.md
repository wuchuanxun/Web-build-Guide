# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding  images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few  non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

> You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
> - [Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
> - Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
> - Files with the .md or .markdown extension

# Syntax guide
Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers
Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.
You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.
If you'd like to quote someone, use the  `>` character before the line:  
`>` Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.  
`>` -Captain Janeway

Here is the overview of quote：
> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> -Captain Janeway
